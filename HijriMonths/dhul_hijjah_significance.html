<li>Dhul Hijjah is the twelfth month of the Islamic Hijri calendar</li>
<li>Dhul Hijjah is one of the four sacred months . The other three are Dhul Qadah, Muharram and Rajab</li>
<li>Dhul Hijjah is literally "possessor of Hajj" since this is the month of Hajj, the pilgrimage</li>
<li>Allah (swt) takes an oath by the first ten days of this month: “By the dawn; by the ten nights” (al-Fajr 89:1-2)</li>
<li>Tradition of the Prophet (&#xFDFA;): There are no days during which righteous deeds are more beloved to Allah than these days (Sunan Ibn Majah)</li>
<li>Tradition of the Prophet (&#xFDFA;): Fasting the Day of Arafat will be credited with Allah by forgiving one’s sins of the previous year and the following year (Muslim)</li>
